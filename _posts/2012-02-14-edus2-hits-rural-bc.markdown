title: edus2 in rural BC - the first working clone
---

[edus2](http://www.edus2.com) collaboration strikes again!

Jel Coward, an MD with a keen interest in open source projects, and his team have created their own working edus2 machine.  This is the first confirmed replication of the project and a significant milestone for is.

With this we found a few bugs.  He installed it on an earlier version of Ubuntu and had to tweak a few things to work.  None-the-less the system is up and running.

These changes will be integrated into the git repository under a separate branch in case anyone else is interested in running on an older version of Ubuntu.

All the hiccups encountered could go away if we had someone with a bit of free time and an interest in the project could package the program for Ubuntu.

Outstanding [issues](https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/issues)

* Probe design
* Ubuntu packages
* Automatic card setup software

Anyone interested please contact me, or just go the [edus2](http://www.edus2.com) and get started by forking the project.
