title: Simulation Thermometer Begins
---

I'm creating a simple simulated digital thermometer for use in medical simulation labs.  To get things going fast I'm planning on just using an Arduino, a potentiometer, and a 7 segment led array.

The instructor will set the temperature using the potentiometer and the student will get the result displayed back when they check the manequins temperature.  Blinking lights and a beeper will make it act more like a real hospital thermometer.

Parts are in!  Once exams are over I estimated a half-day of hacking should get it done.
