The raspberry pi site has an excellent quick-start guide [http://www.raspberrypi.org/quick-start-guide].

* USB-based microSD card reader to write the image to
* 


## Installation ##

1. Download an install image, we used Raspbian "wheezy" from [here](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads)
2. Various options for loading the SD card are given [here](http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup).  We unzipped the imaged and used dd to install it as they describe for Mac OS X.
