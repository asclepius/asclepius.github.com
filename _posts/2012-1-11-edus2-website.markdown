The <a href="http://www.edus2.com">edus2 website</a> has come a long way.  The basic format is now intact and all that remains are some touch ups and adding photos and video demonstration of the system.


The next step is to finish the system for automatically prompting the user to scan a tag for each video in a given folder.  Once this is done the automation process will make setup a lot more user friendly.


After the quick-setup feature is finished the whole thing will be bundled into a linux distribution that will simply boot to the running program.  Once this is put together the user can simply download and burn the iso, insert the disk, and install the system.  It removes the hassle of adding python packages and setting up software.  The laptop will most likely be dedicated to the lab so no issues with dual booting will be required.

If anyone want to get involved with an open source project and package this up for Ubuntu that would be appreciated as well!
