## edus2 updates ##

I recently joined (Saskatoon Techworks)[http://sktechworks.ca] which means... ACCESS TO 3D PRINTING!  CNC MACHINES!  AWESOME!  As well as the vast knowledgebase of the local hacker community.   With a little help from ortho resident/former professional draftsman Blair O I'm hoping to get a slick probe made up for the edus2 machine.

Follow the blog at [www.edus2.com] for updates on this.

## CaRMS ##

The package has been delivered.  Next is interviews.  Life can resume as normal for a while and maybe I can study a bit for this upcoming licensing exam.

## Greystone Heights Makerspace ##

The kids have been enjoying the blinkenlights.  Maybe its time for some robots?  Or webcams hackery?  Any involved kids/parents please come up with some suggestions for what you guys want to do.

## Deer hunting ##

Success.  Antlers and all.  Venison jerky pending.
