title: edus2 website updates
---

I have been furiously updating [edus2](http://www.edus2.com) in anticipation of the trip to the SAEM AGM in Chicago. A new twitter account [edus2sim](http://www.twitter.com/edus2sim) has been created specifically for edus2 updates.  The blog and website format have been heavily updated.

In addition I have started dragging in some of the changes to that site over to this one as well.  Hopefully I can start creating a nice resume with all these things for the upcoming CaRMS showdown.
