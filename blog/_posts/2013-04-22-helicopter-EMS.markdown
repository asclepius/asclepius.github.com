I hear a couple of guys talking in a coffee shop the other day about STARS.  It got me thinking about how expensive this is and wondering if there is any strong evidence that it makes a difference.

As I am entering a career in orthopaedic surgery, I was most interested in trauma outcomes.  My medline search was as follows:

1. \*Emergency Medical Services/ or \*Air Ambulances/ (22208)
2. \*"Wounds and Injuries"/mo \[Mortality\] (2132)
3. 1 and 2 (148)
4. helicopter.mp. (1933)
5. 3 and 4 (30)

The search results as of 22 April 2013 are [here](/images/citation-2013-04-22.pdf), this pdf will let UofS users link directly to the articles, others will have to look them up through their own institution's library.
 
Galvagno et al concluded that outcomes were improved, however the following JAMA issue had many letters to the editor outlining flaws in how missing data points were dealt with among other study design flaws.  The majority of the articles seem to conclude little mortality benefit though some showed benefit in specific subpopulations.

Of course, these studies were not done in our unique prairie environment.  STARS is used for transporting hospital to hospital as well as for trauma.  I don't know what the requirement are for the EMS to get to the chopper but I am interested to find out.  Once the LMCC is out of the way, maybe I can do some more reading on the topic.

If you have articles for or against improved trauma outcomes please comment below.
