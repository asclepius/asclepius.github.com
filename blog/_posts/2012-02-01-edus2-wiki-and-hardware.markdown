The [edus2 wiki](https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/wiki "github: edus2 wiki") underwent a lot of changes over the weekend.  A set of step-by-step instructions has been added to the [Installation](https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/wiki/Installation) page.  Anyone that has some experience with the command line should have no problem with it.

The weak link with the system right now is making a nice-looking probe.  My colleague/friend/cousin Erik Kulyk has decided to help out with the project and is looking in to a professionally fabricated probe.

The outstanding [Issues](https://github.com/asclepius/edus2/issues) now include:

* Probe design
* Automation of the initial setup process
* Ubuntu package for quick installation
