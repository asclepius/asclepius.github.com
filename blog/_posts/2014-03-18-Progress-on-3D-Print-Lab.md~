I have officially moved in to the new office.  The computer is set up and some initial progress has been made.

Tools I have found useful so far:

* [OsiriX](http://www.osirix-viewer.com/)
* [DeVIDE](http://www.cg.its.tudelft.nl/Projects/DeVIDE)
* [MeshLab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/)
* [Slic3r](http://slic3r.org/)
