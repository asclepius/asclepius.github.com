Over the past few days I've completed some of the pending work on the <a href="http://asclepius.github.com/edus2">EDUS2 project.</a>  The prototype has been working for sometime, but now the code has been uploaded to github and a basic description has been submitted.  A full description with images, instructions for building, material, and a usage video will follow shortly.

The thermomulator code has been completed and <a href="http://asclepius.github.com/Thermomulator">uploaded.</a>  It's pretty basic.  The trickier part is squeezing it into a box that looks like a thermometer, this is almost done just waiting for the drill to recharge to finish putting some holes in the cases to connect the sensors.  Maybe a drill press should be added to the Christmas list?
