Effective orthopaedic surgery requires an understanding of the three-dimensional structure and mechanical properties of bone.  
Rapid-prototyping, or 3D-printing, allows conversion of digital CT data into a physical model to aid this understanding.  
This technology has recently become much more accessible to the public through relatively inexpensive mass market 3D printers.  
It has already been combined with orthopaedics as a tool for operative planning, rehearsal, and teaching; however, the steps involved to create the models remains complex and expensive.  
We aim to develop an open source system to create three-dimensional models for preoperative planning and student teaching without requiring training in running complex software packages.  

Based on a review of available 3D printers, two have been purchased: an Ultimaker 2 and a Form-1.  Proof of concept models using the open source tools 3D Slicer and MeshLab have been developed.  Further exploration of available tool sets will be performed. A detailed tutorial and documentation of the process will be produced and made available under an open source license.

We expect to find that 3D models of DICOM images can be created with relative ease and at little expense.  
Inexpensive systems available on the market should allow any department access to this educational tool.  
Once the initial system is set up, further use in providing models for surgical planning will be explored.
