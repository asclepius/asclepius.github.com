  <h1><em>DRAFT</em></h1>

<p>Having just finished the CaRMS process I had some time to reflect on my successes and mistakes.  Here are some of the rules I wish I had followed.</p>

<h3>Book all your diversity electives in the first block</h3>

<p>At the University of Saskatchewan we are required to do at least two weeks in at least three different core specialties.  ie.  2 weeks of internal medicine or an internal medicine subspecialty + 2 weeks of family medicine + 9 weeks of whatever you are a super gunner for.  Unfortunately, not everyone knows they want to be an otolaryngologist or radiation oncologist from day one.  Electives should be a way for you to decide what to do, unfortunately the hidden curriculum makes them a lot more than this.  In my case I was hoping to get an aerospace medicine elective in my second block which I intended to use as a diversity.  I was - fairly - sure I wanted to do emergency medicine at the time.  As such I booked my first block as a local 2 weeks EM and 2 weeks ortho then 3 weeks EM at Dalhousie. In the end I did not get the aerospace med elective <em>and</em> I changed my mind from EM to the orthopaedic surgery.  In my second block I now had to scramble to do some more electives relevant to orthopedics to demonstrate my interest.  Additionally, it limited my exposure to other programs which has further implications...</p>

<h3>Do electives in lots of different places that you might want to go to</h3>

<p>You can meet the staff and residents at your local program when doing your core rotations or medical or surgical selectives (with an "S").  Elective are the only opportunity you have to go to other programs and show them how awesome you are at specialty X and how cool of a dude you would be to have around for the next 2-6 years.  One program director actually said in our CaRMS tour: "If we haven't had you at our location we will likely rank you behind those who have been here.  From our perspective, the devil you know is better than the one you don't."</p>

<p>My mistakes so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not knowing from birth I wanted to do orthopaedics.</li>
<li>Trying to do fancy things with electives (and not getting my diversities done early).</li>
</ol>


<p>I ended up doing 4 weeks of orthopaedics in Saskatoon, 2 weeks in Calgary, and 2 weeks in Ottawa.  Only being exposed to ortho at 3 sites! If I had played the game a little better I could have done my EM and family diversities first block plus 3 weeks of ortho out of province, then 2 weeks in province on selective, then visited 3 more sites in my next block for a total of 4 out of province visits.  Exposing me to more staff for reference letters as well as letting me get to know the programs I might be interested in.  The CaRMS tour does not give a lot of time for you to really know a program and they all seem to put on a nice show for potential applicants so it helps to know what you are getting in to.</p>

<p>This brings me to my next point.</p>

<h3>Work hard all the time and get a lot of letters</h3>

<p>Not just from your choice discipline, but from any rotation on where you have impressed the faculty.  At your local institution be sure that staff in different departments will talk to each other about your performance so even just working hard might make the difference.</p>

<p>If you decide before your second elective block (which many people do) it doesn't hurt to have generic letters from many source to choose from when applying.  Maybe later you will decide to pursue one of these specialties and you could tell the staff how your time with them influenced them to change careers and ask if they could please write you a discipline-specific letter.</p>

<p>People do change their mind.  More letters is never worse.  Ask!  Lots!  The worst that can happen is they can say no.  CaRMS cover letter stuff doesn't open early, but you can always drop off a resume with staff and a log of some of the memorable experiences you had with them so when your CaRMS account goes live you can get them to submit something.</p>

<p>The other thing about working hard is that the residents who will be working with you want to know this as well!  They don't get to make the program rank order list but it doesn't hurt for them to like you.  Also, there is a fine line between being smart in front of a surgeon and stepping on a residents toes.  Tread cautiously when dropping some sweet knowledge that the resident didn't happen to remember at the time.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>I didn't get interviews everywhere in the country this year, but I managed to match to what I wanted, the University of Saskatchewan Orthopaedic Surgery program.  I'm very happy with how things ended up, but a lot of CaRMS still seems like a mystery.  Set yourself up for success, learn from what others tell you.  Some of this might be late for 2014 but hopefully some is still relevant.  Comment or questions below.</p>
