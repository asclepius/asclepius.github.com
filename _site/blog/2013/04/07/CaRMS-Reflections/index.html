  <p>Having just finished the CaRMS process I had some time to reflect on my successes and mistakes. Here are some of the rules I wish I had followed.</p>

<h3>Book all your diversity electives in the first block</h3>

<p>At the University of Saskatchewan we are required to do at least two weeks in at least three different core specialties. ie. 2 weeks of internal medicine or an internal medicine subspecialty + 2 weeks of family medicine + 9 weeks of whatever you are a super gunner for. Unfortunately, not everyone knows they want to be an otolaryngologist or radiation oncologist from day one. Electives should be a way for you to decide what to do, unfortunately the hidden curriculum makes them a lot more than this. In my case I was hoping to get an aerospace medicine elective in my second block which I intended to use as a diversity elective. I was fairly sure I wanted to do emergency medicine at the time. As such I booked my first block as a local 2 weeks EM and 2 weeks ortho then 3 weeks EM at Dalhousie. In the end I did not get the aerospace med elective and I changed my mind from EM to the orthopaedic surgery. As a result, I had to scramble to do more orthopedics electives in my second block to demonstrate my interest and commitment. Additionally, it limited my exposure to other programs which has further implications...</p>

<h3>Do electives in lots of different places that you might want to go to</h3>

<p>You can meet the staff and residents at your local program when doing your core rotations or medical or surgical <em>S</em>electives (with an "S"). Elective are the only opportunity you have to go to other programs and show them how awesome you are at specialty X and how cool of a dude you would be to have around for the next 2-6 years. On our CaRMS tour one program director actually said: "If we haven't had you at our location we will likely rank you behind those who have been here. From our perspective, the devil you know is better than the one you don't."</p>

<p>My mistakes so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not knowing from birth I wanted to do orthopaedics.</li>
<li>Trying to do fancy things with electives (and not getting my diversities done early).</li>
</ol>


<p>I ended up doing 4 weeks of orthopaedics in Saskatoon, 2 weeks in Calgary, and 2 weeks in Ottawa. I only got to be seen at 3 sites! If I had played the game a little better I could have done my EM and family diversities in first block along with 3 weeks of ortho out of province, then done 2 weeks of ortho in-province on selective, and finished by visiting 3 more sites in my next block for a total of 5 orthopedics programs. This would have exposed me to more staff for reference letters as well as letting me get to know which programs I was most interested in. The CaRMS tour does not give a lot of time for you to get to know a program and they all seem to put on a nice show for potential applicants. Visiting on electives helps you know what you are getting in to.</p>

<p>This brings me to my next point.</p>

<h3>Work hard all the time and get a lot of letters</h3>

<p>Not just from your choice discipline, but from any rotation on where you have impressed the faculty. At your local institution be sure that staff in different departments will talk to each other about your performance so even just working hard might make the difference.</p>

<p>If you decide on what you will be applying for before your second elective block (which many people do) it doesn't hurt to have generic letters from many source to choose from when applying. If you decide to pursue one of these specialties later you could tell the staff how your time with them influenced them to change careers and ask if they could please write you a discipline-specific letter.</p>

<p>People do change their mind. More letters is never worse. Ask! Lots! The worst that can happen is they can say no. A caveat here would be to ask from people you think you have impressed.  Also, put the qualifier “strong” in front of letter.  If they can't write you a strong one don't bother, but have the discussion.  CaRMS cover letter stuff doesn't open early (I think there may have been some trouble with the early letter system our year), but you can always drop off a resume with staff and along with a log of some of the memorable experiences you had with them so that when your CaRMS account goes live they will be prepared to submit something.</p>

<p>The other thing about working hard is that the residents who will be working with you want to know this as well! They don't get to make the program rank order list but it doesn't hurt for them to like you. Also, there is a fine line between being smart in front of a surgeon and stepping on a resident’s toes. Tread cautiously when dropping sweet knowledge that the resident didn't happen to remember at the time.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>I didn't get interviews everywhere in the country this year, but I managed to match to what I wanted: the University of Saskatchewan Orthopaedic Surgery program. I'm very happy with how things ended up, but a lot of CaRMS still seems like a mystery. Set yourself up for success and learn from what others tell you. Comment or questions below.</p>
