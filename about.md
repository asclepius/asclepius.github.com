# About

### Paul Kulyk, B.Eng., B.Sc. (3-year)

I am a senior medical student at the University of Saskatchewan.  Previously, I worked in the telecommunications industry as a computer engineer.  I begin my residency in orthopaedic surgery at the University of Saskatchewan this summer!

My claim to fame in the EM community is the [edus2](http://www.edus2.com) project, an open source emergency department ultrasound simulator for adding bedside ultrasound to existing simulation suites for a minimal cost.
